## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Learning Vite/React, I had a hard time learning how to deploy site and 
make changes on a finished/published site.

### Continued development

I would like to return to this project and try landscape views for responsive web design.

### Useful resources
